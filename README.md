# Blockchain App

A simple blockchain-powered web application built with React. This project demonstrates basic blockchain concepts, smart contract interactions, and a user-friendly frontend for decentralized applications (DApps).

## Features

- Connects to Ethereum-compatible blockchains (e.g., via MetaMask)
- Allows users to interact with smart contracts
- Shows transaction history and blockchain data in real-time
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or another web3 wallet (for blockchain features)
